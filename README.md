# JavaScript and DOM Manipulation - UFO Sighting Data

# Overview -

Create a website to display UFO sighting data that can be filtered by various fields like: Date, City, State, Country, Shape, Comment.

I created a Javascript that listens for events when a search criteria is selected and appends the data that matches to the table dynamically. 
The website created looks like this -
